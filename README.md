# Automated DNS Censorship using Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and link to the preprocessed datasets associated with the paper [Augmenting Rule-based DNS Censorship Detection at Scale with Machine Learning
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02031) which presents methods to detect and analyze DNS censorship at scale using machine learning. The paper uses two datasets: [OONI](https://ooni.org/) and [Satellite](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3241189.3241215) (obtained from [Censored Planet](https://censoredplanet.org/)).

For ease of use, the associated code for each dataset (and the pointers to download the preprocssed datasets) is located in separate branches: [ooni-ml](https://github.com/noise-lab/automated-dns-censorship/tree/ooni-ml) for OONI and [satellite-ml](https://github.com/noise-lab/automated-dns-censorship/tree/satellite-ml) for Satellite.

The preprocessed data for OONI is publicly available at [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oR3P96_e-GvkzFsoz-z8j_heC9mvF6Zn/view?usp=sharing)
